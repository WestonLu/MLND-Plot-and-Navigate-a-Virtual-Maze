The tester program can be run as follows:

python tester.py <maze_file_name>  <controller_name>

python tester.py test_maze_02.txt random

If you want to see the maze it mapped, use command line as follows, in the mapped maze, closed blocks means the robot has not reached and sensored there:

python showmaze.py maze.txt

The following is a list of controller names:
